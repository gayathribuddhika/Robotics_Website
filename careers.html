<h3>Common Uses</h3>
<p>Industrial robotics have emerged as a popular manufacturing methodology in several areas in recent years, including welding, materials transport, assembly, and spray finishing operations.</p>

<h2><u>SPOT AND ELECTRIC ARC WELDING</u></h2>
<p>Welding guns are heavy and the speed of assembly lines requires precise movement, thus creating an ideal niche for robotics. Parts can be welded either through the movement of the robot or by keeping the robot relatively stationary and moving the part past the robot. The latter method has come into widespread use since it generally requires less expensive conveyor systems. The control system of the robot must synchronize the robot with the speed of the assembly line and with other robots working on the line. Control systems may also count the number of welds completed and derive productivity data.</p>

<h2><u>PICK AND PLACE OPERATIONS</u></h2>
<p>Industrial robots also perform what are referred to as pick and place operations. Among the most common of these operations is loading and unloading pallets, used across a broad range of industries. This requires relatively complex programming, as the robot must sense how full a pallet is and adjust its placements or removals accordingly. Robots have been vital in pick and place operations in the casting of metals and plastics. In the die casting of metals, for instance, productivity using the same die-casting machinery has increased up to three times, the result of robots' greater speed, strength, and ability to withstand heat in parts removal operations.</p>

<h2><u>ASSEMBLY</u></h2>
<p>Assembly is one of the most demanding operations for industrial robots. A number of conditions must be met for robotic assembly to be viable, among them that the overall production system be highly coordinated and that the product be designed with robotic assembly in mind. The sophistication of the control system required implies a large initial capital outlay, which generally requires production of 100,000 to one million units per year in order to be profitable. Robotic assembly has come to be used in the production of a wide range of goods, including circuit boards, electronic components and equipment, household appliances, and automotive subassemblies.</p>

<h2><u>SPRAY FINISHING OPERATIONS</u></h2>
<p>Industrial robots are widely used in spray finishing operations, particularly in the automobile industry. One of the reasons these operations are cost-effective is that they minimize the need for environmental control to protect workers from fumes.
Robots are also used for quality control inspections, since they can be programmed to quantitatively measure various aspects of a product's creation. In addition, the use of robots in environmental applications, such as the cleaning of contaminated sites and the handling and analysis of hazardous materials, represents an important growth market for robotics producers. Non-industrial applications for robots in security, commercial cleaning, food service, and health care are also on the rise.

<h3>Careers</h3>
<img class="img1" src="eng.jpg">
<p><b>Robotics Engineer</b><br>
This is a profession for someone with a lot of patience, besides a lot of training in engineering. An engineer has the responsibility for developing the robot on paper. This creation can take quite some time, because of research and the high technicality and sophistication of robotics. Then, as it’s being built, he will oversee practically every aspect of the development of the robot, from safety to testing to analyzing and reviewing every movement.
An engineer will also need to debug any problem within the software system. Because of the need to oversee every project, engineers don’t create very many robots throughout their careers. This type of robotics job is very technical and time consuming.
</p>
<p><b>Software Developer</b><br>
Each robot needs to have a computerized internal system that is highly efficient in operating the machine. This schematic design is written and coded by the software developer along with the engineer to assure the robot performs the functions it’s designed to carry out in a safe and precise way. Obviously, the software developer has to be very efficient in computer coding and software design.
</p><br>
<p><b>Technician</b><br>
There are a couple types of technicians. A robotics technician can repair and maintain robots and build some robotic parts along with other tasks.
An electromechanical technician works with the engineer in the design process of new robots.
</p>
<p><b>Sales Engineer</b><br>
Sales engineers must know the products inside and out, as they will be attempting to sell advanced technological robots and their designs to potential customers. They must also be able to consult with the buyer and make any changes in the design to satisfy their needs.
</p>
<p><b>Operators</b><br>
Of course every robot has to have someone operating and overseeing it 24 hours a day. In case anything should go wrong or break down, someone would need to be on top of the situation immediately. That’s where an operator comes in. Working in shifts around the clock, they ensure everything goes smoothly.
They are also needed to operate and repair such equipment as flying drones, undersea robots and robots designed for military activities.
</p>
<p><b>Robotics Account Manager</b><br>
Yes, there are even jobs within the robotics field that include accounting. For this, an individual would need a strong background in robot technology, sales, accounting, and customer service. He or she would need to be outgoing yet independent, and have a strong personality to connect with and make sales to customers within the robotics industry.
