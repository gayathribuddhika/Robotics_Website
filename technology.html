	<h1><center>Robotic Technologies</center></h1>
	<p>Robotics technologies consist of all processes necessary to design, build and maintain robots and other intelligent machines. Robots are sophisticated, intelligent systems used to assist pilots and maneuver spacecraft without direct human intervention. They're also the commonplace automated systems that fill our factories and everyday lives.Because of this diversity of robotics applications, professionals in the field work in a wide variety of industries, from defense and aerospace to manufacturing and design. Within these industries, there are two main roles for personnel with training in robotics technologies. Robotics workers can be divided into robotics engineers and robotics technicians. Robotics engineers are responsible for developing new robotics systems and upgrading the old ones to meet contemporary demands. Technicians, on the other hand, maintain and repair already-existing robotics technology.Robotics technology is a multifarious field with many different opportunities for education and employment</p>
	<p>Today's robotics systems operate by way of hydraulic, pneumatic, and electrical power. Electric motors have become progressively smaller, with high power-to-weight ratios, enabling them to become the dominant means by which robots are powered.
Robots are, of course, comprised of several different elements, depending on their purpose. The hand of a robot, for instance, is referred to in the industry as an "end effector." End effectors may be specialized tools, such as spot welders or spray guns, or more general-purpose grippers. Common grippers include fingered and vacuum types. Another central element of robotics control technology is the sensor. It is through sensors that a robotic system receives knowledge of its environment, to which subsequent actions of the robot can be adjusted. Sensors are used to enable a robot to adjust to variations in the position of objects to be picked up, to inspect objects, and to monitor proper operation (although some robots are able to adjust to variations in object placement without the use of sensors, provided they have sufficient end effector flexibility). Important sensor types include visual, force and torque, speed and acceleration, tactile, and distance sensors. The majority of industrial robots use simple binary sensing, analogous to an on/off switch. This does not permit sophisticated feedback to the robot as to how successfully an operation was performed. Lack of adequate feedback also often requires the use of guides and fixtures to constrain the motions of a robot through an operation, which implies substantial inflexibility in changing operations.

<p>Robots are programmed either by guiding or by off-line programming. Most industrial robots are programmed by the former method. This involves manually guiding a robot from point to point through the phases of an operation, with each point stored in the robotic control system. With off-line programming, the points of an operation are defined through computer commands. This is referred to as manipulator level off-line programming. An important area of research is the development of off-line programming that makes use of higher-level languages, in which robotic actions are defined by tasks or objectives.
Robots may be programmed to move through a specified continuous path instead of from point to point. Continuous path control is necessary for operations such as spray painting or arc welding a curved joint. Programming also requires that a robot be synchronized with the automated machine tools or other robots with which it is working. Thus robot control systems are generally interfaced with a more centralized control system.

<h2>Future of Robotics</h2>
<p>Recent research and development has addressed a number of aspects of robotics. Robotic hands have been developed which offer greater dexterity and flexibility, and improvements have been made in visual sensors as well (earlier generations of visual sensors were designed for use with television and home video, and did not process information quickly for optimal performance in many robotics applications; as a consequence, solid-state vision sensors came into increased use, and developments were also made with fiber optics). The use of superconducting materials, meanwhile, offers the possibility of substantial improvements in the electric motors that drive robotic arms. Attempts have also been made to develop lighter robotic arms and increase their rigidity. Standardization of software and hardware to facilitate the centralization of control systems has also been an important area of development in recent years. Indeed, "robots are simply more programmable and flexible than ever before," wrote Tooling and Production contributor Katina Z. Jones. "Multiple cells can be more easily accommodated and cybernetic gadgetry such as virtual reality and computer simulation have added a new dimension to the sales and installation of robotics." Finally, the processing speed of robotic brains was expected to increase from 10 MIPS in 2000 to 1,000 MIPS by 2003.</p><br>

<h3><u>Robotis in 2020</u></h3>
<p>* <b>Microbots</b> allow emergency responders to explore environments that are too small or too dangerous for humans or larger robots; deploying them in “swarms” compensates for their relatively limited computational ability.</p>
<p>* <b>Exoskeletons</b> allow users to augment their physical strength, helping those with physical disabilities to walk and climb, it also finds application in the military.</p>
<p>* <b>Body-machine interfaces</b> help amputees to feed-forward controls that detect their will to move and also receive sensorial feedback that converts digital readings to &nbsp&nbsp&nbspfeelings.</p>
<p>* <b>Modular robots</b> bring forth LEGO® like robotic cubes that can arrange themselves in preset patterns to accomplish specific tasks.</p>
<p>* <b>Intelligent robots</b> combine artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies to give robots human-like expressions and reactions.</p>
<p>* <b>Robotic strength</b> increases as elastic nanotubes give robots muscles that are more compact and stronger than human muscles; allowing robots to outrun and out-jump &nbsp&nbsp&nbsphumans.</p>
<p>* <b>Alternately powered robots</b> use sources like solar, wind and wave energy to be powered indefinitely and open up applications in areas that are off-grid.</p>
<p>* <b>Robotic networks</b> emerge and allow robots to access databases, share information and learn from one another’s experience.</p>
<p>* <b>Telepresence robots</b> act as your stand-in at remote locations saving business travelers both time and money.</p>
